## Motivation

The motivation behind developing an automated vulnerability scanner script stems from the increasing complexity and sophistication of cybersecurity threats faced by organisations today. Traditional vulnerability assessment methods, while effective, often require significant time and resources to manually identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities. This manual approach becomes impractical in dynamic environments with a large number of systems, applications, and network infrastructure components. So, the automated vulnerability scanner can provide efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
